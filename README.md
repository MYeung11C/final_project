# Topic
Stroke Mortality Rate per 100k in US
This topic was picked based off a personal interest in the subject due to family members in the past having experienced strokes. I added in the median household income via US Census data to see if there was a correlation between income and mortality rate. 

# Source
The source of the data was pulled off ARCGIS data on ailments across the US, specifically strokes. The Median household income in the US was taken from the US Census data.

# Question
The questions I hope to answer with this data is:
Is there a correlation between stroke mortality rate and income?

Is there a correlation overall, to ailment mortality rates and income?
