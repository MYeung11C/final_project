# Topic
Stroke Mortality Rate per 100k in US
This topic was picked based off a personal interest in the subject due to family members in the past having experienced strokes. I added in the median household income via US Census data to see if there was a correlation between income and mortality rate. 

# Source
The source of the data was pulled off ARCGIS data on ailments across the US, specifically strokes. The Median household income in the US was taken from the US Census data.

# Question
The questions I hope to answer with this data is:
Is there a correlation between stroke mortality rate and income?

Is there a correlation overall, to ailment mortality rates and income?

On Tableau, we can see the trendline through the many data points that are plotted to income vs ailments such as COPD, Coronary disease, Diabetes, Heart Failure, Kidney Disease, Stroke Mortality rates all per 100k population. The Trendline Indicates that there is a downward trend in the data, meaning the higher the income, the lower the ailment mortality rate appears to be.

Also on Tableau, we can see the separate trendlines showing a slight decrease towards the higher rates of income, most notable is the stroke mortality rate per 100k, where that specific trendline does a sharp decline towards the higher income levels. This hints at families with higher income are likely to survive strokes when compared to lower income families.

In excel the data was extracted onto a separate sheet and compiled onto a pivot table, where the income and stroke mortality rate were with the respective states. The color codes indicate the higher the mortality rate being red, whereas the lower the mortality rate it went to yellow and green at the lowest points. The data was sorted by the average stroke mortality rates from high to low, where you can see on the table that as the color turned to green, the incomes were usually higher. This backs up the chart of stroke rate vs income on tableau.

The next set of data is presented in a pivot table on excel and includes COPD, Coronary disease, Diabetes, Kidney disease on top of Stroke mortality rates per 100k, the same as the tableau chart. 
Mortality rate per 100k seems to have better results, although the trend still appears to be that the lower the income, the worse off the population is in regards to mortality rates in ailments overall.
